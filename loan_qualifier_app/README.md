# Loan Qualifier CLI app

This is a command-line interface application for searching qualifying loans across a list of financial institutions. The application asks the user to provide a list of banks and loan products offered. Based on the loan applicant's financial info, the application filters through the available loan options. The result list of banks and loan alternatives can be saved to a CSV file if the user wishes to do so and provides a location path to save the file.
